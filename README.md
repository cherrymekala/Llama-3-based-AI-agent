#Llama-3 based AI agent
  In this project I have built an AI agent, which basically responds to the user prompts for a specific use-case.

#Here are the steps that I have followed:-
  1) Load and Index data
  2) Build user query analyzer
  3) Create RAG Pipeline
  4) Identifier function
  5) Chat template

  I hope you will like it and it can be adapted to many other use-cases, and I'm open for suggestions and contributions. Feel free to leave a comment.
