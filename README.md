# Llama-3 Based AI Agent

In this project, I have built an AI agent that responds to user prompts for a specific use case.

## Steps Followed

1. **Load and Index Data**  
   The first step involves loading and indexing the necessary data to ensure the AI agent has access to relevant information for responding to user queries.

2. **Build User Query Analyzer**  
   This involves creating a component that analyzes user queries to understand their intent and extract relevant details.

3. **Create RAG Pipeline**  
   A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline is constructed to combine information retrieval and generation, improving the quality and accuracy of responses.

4. **Identifier Function**  
   An identifier function is implemented to identify and extract specific elements or products from user queries, structuring them in a usable format.

5. **Chat Template**  
   A chat template is designed to standardize the format of user interactions and responses, ensuring consistency and clarity in communication.
